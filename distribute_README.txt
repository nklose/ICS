V1.0

Installation
============
1. Run the provided setup.exe, and complete the steps listed.
2. If the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable setup starts, install it as well.
3. ImageMagick install will start. Please install only if ImageMagick is not installed on your machine.
4. Run the Image Correlation Spectroscopy from the start menu.

Working Features
================
1. Auto and Cross correlations calculate and display all output.
2. RGB and monochrome images can be loaded, and are displayed in the interface.
3. RGB images, when loaded, are split into each of the three channels. Each channel is previewed in grayscale.
4. The interface provides file checking to ensure images have the correct number of channels and are stored in a compatible format.
5. The interface provides input checking to ensure at least one channel (for autocorrelation) or channel pair (for cross-correlation) has been selected, that no parameters are missing, and that all parameters are numeric.
6. The start button and progress bar are functional. The interface disables the start button when correlation is in place, and jumps to the appropriate output tab.
7. The triple-correlation process.
8. All correlations works.
9. Batch mode works.
10. Results can be saved to the computer.
11. Help tab added. The HELP file in the installation directory may be edited to add information to the help tab. It is a plain text file.
