The following style is currently used in the backend code:
- functions / files are documented using docstrings
- docs for functions have an 'arguments' section and a 'return values'
  section; both args and return values have their type given in brackets 
- the only spaces on a line are around the main assignment operator
  (or around the main relational operator for if conditions);
  there are no spaces between function arguments
- a function f in module m on a variable x with parameters
  y and z is invoked as m.f(x,y,z) rather than x.f(y,z)
- the function str.format is used instead of the % symbol
- numpy is imported as np
- the full name is used for scipy packages
- every file does 'from __future__ import division'
- function and variable names are in lowercase
- function and variable names are separated by underscores
